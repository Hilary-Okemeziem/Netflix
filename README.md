Live demo: https://netflix-7e17a.web.app/

This Netflix clone was built with React JS and is hosted on Firebase. It is a frontend project with a firebase backend.

I made use of TMDB API for all of the data and Firebase for user authentication so users can sign-up and sign-in to their account with an email address in order to save their favorite movies.

I made use of Firestore which is cloud storage of firebase to save data, with this users will be able to store/save specific data(movies) from the frontend by clicking the heart icon.

The project was styled with Tailwind CSS
